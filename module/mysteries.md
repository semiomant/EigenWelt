the point of a mystery is not IMO to pose question __IF__ you can solve it, because not solving it is a fun as dying in a fight or get your play buired in emo glurm.

The point of the mystery is what you do during and at the end of it.

If you want the PLAYERS not the CHARACTERS puzzle on clues, this text does not help.You should go and find those sodoku-like logic puzzle books, because that is then the game you are playing. I am concerned here with building narration and fictional action that amount to a story of finding outthat you can tell later about it.

That is why it is not helpful to think of mysteries and investigations as delicate strings of clues, railroad networks withillusions of failure etc pp. The useful ideas are Layers bounadiers and gates. Elements planned to be a part of the mystery are the layers and there are ways to get from one layer to another: the gates. players can make gates, only if there are __only__ predetermined gates, a layer narrows to the size of a railway.

# during the procedure / info & thrills
The clues point to other elements and where to go to get "deeper in",to the next layer. The question here is to __HOW__ to overcome obstacles to leads (gates) and clues (ideas what where who might be a gate). Clues mean explorin the current layer, leads (well) lead to a "deeper" layer.

alternatives: DCC transylanian prepbuild-up planning ;; TFFB (reducing monster adv ;; or get more resource pools)

# endings / thrills & desicions
So,you found out how things are:now it is time to take action. What do you do?

this is clearlymore interesting if you dont construct black-and-white problems. Maybe killing the judge was somehow a good thing ... basically bad things happen for good reason and the road to hellis paved with good intentions. Or the culprit is too powerful (level- or otherwise).

Here you can have again thriller action with fights, stealth etc.

Or there are no clear bad guys and the fun comes from making your own choice and see it through.
